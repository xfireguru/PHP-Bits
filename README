sendPush.php--

sendPush.php contains a function I found useful when attempting to send an API call to Parse.com.  I had the command to initiate a push notification to Android working from  curl in the command-line, but attempts at a libcurl conversion for use in PHP failed miserably.

The provided code snippet will successfully talk to the API at Parse.com and initiate a push notification.
